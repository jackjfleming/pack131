    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Forest Green -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a tabbed, single-page dashboard. The user lands on a 'Dashboard' view with high-level stats (volunteer needs, finances, next event) for a quick overview. They can then navigate to dedicated sections: 'Full Calendar' for a detailed, filterable timeline of all events; 'Volunteer Hub' to see and respond to open leadership roles, visualized with a chart to stress urgency; and 'Action Items' which consolidates all tasks into one actionable list. This structure was chosen to transform the linear, text-heavy report into a task-oriented tool. It separates 'at-a-glance' information from 'deep-dive' details, allowing parents to quickly find what's relevant to them, whether it's the next meeting date or a specific volunteer need, which is far more usable than parsing a long email. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Vacant Leader Roles (7). Goal: Compare/Alert. Viz: Doughnut Chart in 'Volunteer Hub'. Interaction: Hover to see counts. Justification: A visual representation of the leadership gap is more impactful than a simple list, encouraging action. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Event Types. Goal: Organize/Summarize. Viz: Bar Chart on 'Dashboard'. Interaction: Hover to see event counts. Justification: Provides a high-level summary of the year's activities (e.g., more campouts than meetings). Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Full event list. Goal: Inform/Change. Viz: Interactive chronological timeline in 'Full Calendar'. Interaction: Filter by month/quarter. Justification: A visual timeline is more engaging and easier to scan for dates than a long bulleted list. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Action items scattered in email. Goal: Organize/Action. Viz: Consolidated table/list in 'Action Items' tab. Interaction: Clickable contact links. Justification: Centralizes all tasks, making it clear what needs to be done and by whom, which was impossible with the original format. Method: HTML/JS.
